title: "Computational analysis of sequencing based SARS-CoV-2 testing data"
---

## Overview

Several groups have been developing large scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 based on high-throughput sequencing:

- [Jones et al., 2020](https://www.notion.so/Octant-SwabSeq-Testing-9eb80e793d7e46348038aa80a5a901fd) (SwabSeq)
- [Schmid-Burgk et al., 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.025635v1.abstract) (LAMP-Seq)
- [Hossain et al., 2020](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kP2w_uTMSep2UxTCOnUhh1TMCjWvHEY0sUUpkJHPYV4/edit)

These methods have the potential to massively scale the extent of testing at low-cost and with assays that are highly sensitive.

The sequence data that will be generated by the proposed methods consists of two data types:

- (synthetic) sequence barcodes, each of which is associated to a sample.
- (biological)sequences associated with genes. Genes may include viral genes, control genes, or spike-ins.

Pre-processing of the data involves several steps:

- Error correction of the barcode sequences. This is necessary in order to account for sequence errors that may have been introduced during sequencing.
- Association of the biological sequences to their genes of origin.
- Collation of sequences associated to a single sample in order to count the number of times different genes have been observed.

Following pre-processing of the data, analysis must be performed to determine which samples contained SARS-CoV-2, and which didn't. This involves setting thresholds based on the observed viral counts in the context of counts of spike-ins and controls.
